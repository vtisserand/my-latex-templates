\section{Double no-touch option derivation}
\label{appendix:a}

\begin{proof}
We write the Black-Scholes equation under it's heat equation version, then using Fourier series as an \textit{ansatz} and the boundary conditions we identify the coefficients and plug everything back in to have the option value.
\end{proof}
